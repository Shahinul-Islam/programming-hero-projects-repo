    // == Japanese/ShiftJIS ====================================================
    // All japanese encodings are based on JIS X set of standards:
    // JIS X 0201 - Single-byte encoding of ASCII + Â¥ + Kana chars at 0xA1-0xDF.
    // JIS X 0208 - Main set of 6879 characters, placed in 94x94 plane, to be encoded by 2 bytes. 
    //              Has several variations in 1978, 1983, 1990 and 1997.
    // JIS X 0212 - Supplementary plane of 6067 chars in 94x94 plane. 1990. Effectively dead.
    // JIS X 0213 - Extension and modern replacement of 0208 and 0212. Total chars: 11233.
    //              2 planes, first is superset of 0208, second - revised 0212.
    //              Introduced in 2000, revised 2004. Some characters are in Unicode Plane 2 (0x2xxxx)

    // Byte encodings are:
    //  * Shift_JIS: Compatible with 0201, uses not defined chars in top half as lead bytes
