Node.js: fs-extra
=================

`fs-extra` adds file system methods that aren't included in the native `fs` module and adds promise support to the `fs` methods. It also uses [`graceful-fs`](https://github.com/isaacs/node-graceful-fs) to prevent `EMFILE` errors. It should be a drop in replacement for `fs`.

Why?
----

I got tired of including `mkdirp`, `rimraf`, and `ncp` in most of my projects.




Installation
------------

    npm install fs-extra



Usage
-----

`fs-extra` is a drop in replacement for native `fs`. All methods in `fs` are attached to `fs-extra`. All `fs` methods return promises if the callback isn't passed.

You don't ever need to include the original `fs` module again:

```js
const fs = require('fs') // this is no longer necessary
```

you can now do this:

```js
const fs = require('fs-extra')
```

or if you prefer to make it clear that you're using `fs-extra` and not `fs`, you may want
to name your `fs` variable `fse` like so:

```js
const fse = require('fs-extra')
```

you can also keep both, but it's redundant:

```js
const fs = require('fs')
const fse = require('fs-extra')
```

Sync vs Async vs Async/Await
-------------
Most methods are async by default. All async methods will return a promise if the callback isn't passed.

Sync methods on the other hand will throw if an error occurs.

Also Async/Await will throw an error if one occurs.

Example:

```js
const fs = require('fs-extra')

// Async with promises:
fs.copy('/tmp/myfile
